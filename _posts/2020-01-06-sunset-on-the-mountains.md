This artwork is a sunset on the mountains. What i used to draw this piece of artwork is watercolors. 

I drew this piece of artwork with a sunset because i feel like drawing sunsets feel peaceful and kind of calm at the same time.

A couple of different sizes of birds were added and trees added for some details.
