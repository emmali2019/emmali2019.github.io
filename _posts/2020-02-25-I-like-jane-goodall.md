Jane was born in London, April 3, 1934.

One greatest accomplishment Jane did was she learned about Chimpanzees. She discovered Chimpanzee’s behavior, and Chimpanzees make tools, they hunt and eat meat, and a Chimpanzee’s social behavior is similar to human’s behavior. 	

Three interesting facts about Jane Goodall is, Jane devolved her love for animals. Jane is part of The Trimates which attracted woman from her research at Gombe. Jane also did important discoveries during her observations in Gombe. 

What Jane is doing now is she exemplifies the difference a person can make. Now, women lead the field of long-term primate behavioral studies around the world.
