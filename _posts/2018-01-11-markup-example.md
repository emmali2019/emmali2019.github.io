* 1 The Gigantic Airport. 

The bunnies, Sunshine and Fluffy, were in the car with their owners, Linzy and Mark. They were going to New York. Once they got to the airport, Mark said, “Since we are early, let’s go eat at one of the restaurants”. “Sure” said Linzy. Sunshine squeaked to Fluffy that it was going to be so much fun at New York. Fluffy also agreed. While they were eating, Sunshine was eating her fresh carrots, and Fluffy was eating her fresh cabbage.
 
* 2 The Interesting Light.

After the delicious food, it was time go through security check. Linzy took care of the bunnies, and Mark was putting all their luggage in the x-ray machine. Sunshine was interested when she looked at the light on top of the x-ray machine. It turned green every time the luggage went in. Well, sometimes the light turns red. Finally, she figured it out with her own mind. When it turns green, it means there is nothing in the luggage that is not allowed in the ride. If the light turns red, it means there is something in the luggage that is not allowed on the ride.
 
* 3 Sitting in a Flying Thingy.

A little while later, they were sitting on their comfy seats in the flying thing. Sunshine was thinking, what is this flying thingy that they are on? Then a little while later, she figured that their owners and themselves were on an airplane. One hour later, they were halfway to New York. For entertainment, Sunshine watched movies for entertainment.
 
* 4 The Noisy Noises.

Mark said he needed to use the bathroom so, Linzy was taking care of the bunnies. Sunshine noticed Fluffy was asleep, so Sunshine decided to take a nap too. Then she had a problem: she heard some noises in the airplane! The noisy noise bothered her from sleeping. So, she said to herself,” Forget about the loud noises”. Then, she was fast asleep.
 
* 5 The Bright Screen.

When Sunshine woke up, she saw Linzy watching a movie, so Sunshine banged her cage. Then, Linzy heard her banging so she took her out and petted her. Sunshine was staring at the screen. Linzy laughed, and said, “Oh I see what you mean, you want to watch the movie with me, so that is why you banged on your cage. Now don’t make so much noise because you are going to wake up Fluffy and Mark”. Sunshine looked at Mark and Fluffy, they’re still asleep. Then she told herself, Linzy is right, I should be quiet.
 
* 6 The Tallest Hotel I Ever Seen.

When they were landing, Sunshine woke up her sister, Fluffy. The cages almost slid while the airplane was landing. Luckily, Linzy stopped the cages from sliding. A little while later, they were on a taxi that was big enough for two people and two bunnies. The ride took about 30 mins. Linzy told them that they were going to visit someone. Sunshine thought, who could it be? Then they arrived at a hotel. Sunshine said, “Wow” to herself. Then, they went to the front desk to claim their hotel room. They got two cards and a package to put them in, and the package show their room is on the 9th floor and room 467. They went onto the elevator and went up to floor 9.

* 7 The Cool Rooms.

When they got there, they unpacked their luggage. Linzy and Mark let Sunshine and Fluffy explore the rooms. Sunshine told Fluffy in bunny language, “Lets stick together so we won’t get lost.” “Ok” replied Fluffy. They saw large rooms all over the place. When they saw their owners get their small luggage, they hopped as fast as they can to Linzy and Mark. Sunshine and Fluffy were acting like dogs sticking their tongues out. Mark said, “Calm down you guys. We will make your room”. Then Sunshine and Fluffy watched them setting up their rooms. Then Linzy said, “Your room is ready!” 
 
* 8 The Super Cozy, Huge, and Amazing Room!

When they entered their room, their room was amazing! Their room had nice bedding, pictures of bunnies and pictures of themselves, stars hanging down the ceiling, and their favorite plushies! They raced to their bedding and said,” This is soft!” at the same time. They snuggled down for a while. Then they raced to their owners.

* 9 The Yummiest Food I Tasted!

They took the elevator down to 1st floor. Sunshine was shy when children stared at them as they walked to their table. They ordered some food. Sunshine and Fluffy were shaking when they thought they were going to eat human food. Linzy said,” Don’t worry you two bunnies. You won’t eat that.” When they heard that, they calmed down.  Linzy asked Mark to bring the bunny’s food from their room. Sunshine couldn’t believe her eyes when Mark rushed to the elevator because Sunshine never saw that in her whole entire bunny life! When Mark was on his way running back from getting their food, Sunshine and Fluffy could smell their food from their table. Sunshine was imagining that a cloud was carrying the food to them. Fluffy was thinking the same thing too!

* 10 The washy bath.

After the delicious dinner, Linzy had to fold the laundry and Mark had to work so they let the bunnies play and run in their hotel room. A little while later… Linzy called, “Guys! its time for a bath! When they heard that, they hopped as fast as they can to the bathroom. Then they jumped into the water. “Wow!  That was a big splash! “said Sunshine. When their owners arrived, Sunshine and Fluffy splashed together. Linzy said “Whoa! Stop splashing.” Then, they stopped. 
 
* 11 Who is this?

The next morning, Linzy woke up the bunnies and told them they are visiting another hotel. Sunshine wondered, why are we going to another hotel? They went down the elevator, took a taxi, and arrived at a different hotel. Then, they took a different elevator to 3rd floor and went to the first room. Then Linzy picked up Sunshine to knock the door. Then, out came a girl who seemed very young. Linzy introduced the girl, and she was her friend’s daughter. Her name was Sophie. Linzy introduced Sunshine to Sophie. Sophie seemed curious. When Sophie stared Sunshine, Sunshine seemed a little bit nervous. “What if she doesn’t like me? Sunshine asked Fluffy. “I don’t know.” Fluffy replied. Then, suddenly, Sophie said “She is so cute!!”  That made Sunshine and Fluffy feel comfortable. Sophie’s mom talked with Linzy while Sophie, Sunshine, and Fluffy were following Sophie to different rooms. Sophie came to one room and told Sunshine and Fluffy, “This is my room.” Sophie’s room had star stickers on the ceiling, a made bed, plushies, a rug, pictures hanging on the white walls, and a white desk with piles of papers, and a cleaned -out folder sticking out of her backpack along with some books in it.
 
* 12 After visiting in Sophie’s Apartment

After visiting Sophie, they went back to their apartment. Sunshine and Fluffy both took a bath. Then, they went to sleep for the next day. They snuggled in their beds, and Linzy and Mark both said good-night. Then, they turned off the lights and Sunshine and Fluffy went to sleep.

* 13 The next morning

The next morning, Linzy and Mark woke up Sunshine and Fluffy. They told them to sit down to eat their delicious morning breakfast. After that, Linzy and Mark told Sunshine and Fluffy to go to the couch and wait for a moment. After Linzy and Mark came out with their luggage’s, Sunshine and Fluffy gave very confused looks. Linzy and Mark told them they were going back to their homes. Sunshine and Fluffy gave the Can-We -Still- Come- Back- Here looks. Linzy and Mark told them yes. Linzy said they could go to the toy store to buy a toy. So, then they exited out their hotel, went on the taxi, and went to a five-star rating toy store. Sunshine bought a plushie carrot with a smile face on it. Same with Fluffy, but she got a star. Then they took the taxi and went to the airport.

* 14 Good-bye New York!

After they went to the airport, they ate a wonderful dinner, and went to the sitting places to wait for their airplane to arrive. When the airport arrived, they took their luggage’s and went onto to the plane and waited for the plane to board. After the directions of emergencies, the plane boarded. Sunshine said, “Good-Bye New York.
